List of things that should or could be done:

- Simplify our MemRep BaseType instances with overlapping instances (if possible)
- Fix up finites and indexing with constraints
- PR@finite to let `finite` understand the class of `Integral`s instead of just `Integer`s
- Remove Nix stuff and use Stack (hard to get things linked locally otherwise)
- Convert back to original representation
- Square the fields representation
- Remove emptyChoices since it is unneeded

- Write instance for n=0
- Write instances for n up to 4
- experiment in Agda
- Write tests (quickcheck)
